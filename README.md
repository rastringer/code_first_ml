Learn ML by building a framework!

This is a series of notebooks explaining the processes necessary to train neural networks, with a focus on practical implemention in Python code. The work is based on the `minai` framework built in [fast.ai](fast.ai)'s excellent 'From Deep Learning Foundations to Stable Diffusion' course.

The notebooks cover techniques including:

* Matrix multiplication

* Stochastic gradient descent

* Attention

* Activations
